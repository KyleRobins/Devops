# 1. ➱ ⬇️ Installing Jenkins 👇👇👇 

First, update the default Ubuntu packages lists for latest updates with the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
Then, run the following command to install JDK 11:
```bash
sudo apt-get install openjdk-11-jdk
```
Now, we will install Jenkins itself. Issue the following commands in the following sequence to initiate the installation from the Jenkins repository:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install jenkins
```
Once that’s done, start the Jenkins service with the following command:
```bash
sudo systemctl start jenkins.service
```
To confirm its status, use:
```bash
sudo systemctl status jenkins
```
With Jenkins installed, we can proceed with adjusting the firewall settings. By default, Jenkins will run on port 8080.

In order to ensure that this port is accessible, we will need to configure the built-in Ubuntu firewall (ufw). To open the 8080 port and enable the firewall, use the following commands:
```bash
sudo ufw allow 8080
```
```bash
sudo ufw enable
```
Once done, test whether the firewall is active using this command:
```bash
sudo ufw status
```
With the firewall configured, it’s time to set up Jenkins itself. Type in the IP of your EC2 along with the port number in your browser. The Jenkins setup wizard will open.

To check the initial password, use the cat command as indicated below:
```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

All Set! You can now start automating... 🚀🚀☁️☁️

# 2. ➱ Configure ⚙️ and Run ⏺️ Jenkins Behind Apache Reverse Proxy 👇👇👇

Installing Apache
Install Apache from Repo

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
```
Enable proxy, proxy_http, headers module

```bash
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo a2enmod headers
```
Edit 📝 Apache Configuration ⚙️ file
```bash
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
sudo vim jenkins.conf
```
Then, In the file enter the following code snippet to make the Apache works for Jenkins. Then, In this ServerName should be your domain name, ProxyPass should point your localhost point to Jenkins (Port 8080) and ProxyPassReverse should be added for both localhost address and Domain address. In the <proxy> block, we need to give access to the apache to handle the Jenkins.

```bash
<Virtualhost *:80>
    ServerName        your-domain-name.com
    ProxyRequests     Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
 
    <Proxy http://localhost:8080/*>
      Order deny,allow
      Allow from all
    </Proxy>
 
    ProxyPass         /  http://localhost:8080/ nocanon
    ProxyPassReverse  /  http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse  /  http://your-domain-name.com/
</Virtualhost>
```
Enable ✅ and Restart 🔄 Jenkins
```bash
sudo a2ensite jenkins
sudo systemctl restart apache2
sudo systemctl restart jenkins
```
Configuring ⚙️ the Firewall 🔒
```bash
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow http
sudo ufw allow https
```
Now, enable ✅ the firewall 🔒 by passing the following command.
```bash
ufw enable
```
🎉🎉🎉
With that done your Jenkins server will run behind the Apache’s Reverse Proxy.
