# Terraform Directory

This directory contains Terraform configurations for managing infrastructure as code.

## What is Terraform?

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp. It enables you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. With Terraform, you can manage and version your infrastructure efficiently, making it easier to scale and modify as needed.

## Uses of Terraform

Terraform is widely used for:

- **Provisioning Infrastructure**: Create and manage infrastructure components such as virtual machines, networks, and storage in a consistent and repeatable way.

- **Multi-Cloud Deployments**: Manage resources across various cloud providers, allowing you to avoid vendor lock-in and leverage the strengths of different cloud platforms.

- **Version Control for Infrastructure**: Store your infrastructure configurations in version control systems (like Git) to track changes, collaborate with others, and roll back to previous states if needed.

- **Automation and Orchestration**: Automate the deployment and configuration of infrastructure, making it easier to maintain and update over time.
